# About the project
This project was created with the purpose of practicing programming, as well as sharing my opinions about the anime I watch. In this anime review blog, people can view my latest reviews, which include information about the anime such as release date, number of episodes, genres, and more. Additionally, it's possible to see my favorite anime, voice actors, animation studios, animations, and music (OP, ED, OST).

# Tech Stack
To develop this project, Angular was used for the frontend, Tailwind for styling the pages, and Flask (along with Pandas) to return the data displayed on the screen. No database was used, everything is stored locally in JSON or Markdown files.
